        <p style="font-family:verdana"> That's the question you may ask tonight.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Courier New">But the real question is what candy tops the list when it comes to said candy?</p>
        <p style="font-family:verdana">Before that, dance along with the skeleton to the music!</p>

        <p style="font-family:Courier New"> Let's get straight into the rankings!</p>
        <p style="font-family:verdana">Number 5: Hershey's. Hershey's is a great chocolate, though it is simply topped by more unique candies, though it will remain as a top 5 in my books purely due to its sheer versatility, from s'mores to chocolate strawberries.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Courier New">Number 4: Nerds. Nerds are also a very versatile candy, and it's difficult to hate Nerds, as they are basically flavored sugar clumps. However, due to this simplicity, it doesn't really stand out, and goes for quantity over quality, something that I personally disapprove of. While they are good, they just don't quite make the top 3 in my books.</p>
        <p style="font-family:verdana">Number 3: Reese's. Peanut butter cups are always an excellent choice when it comes to candy, and are hard to go wrong with when it comes to the world of candy. This is personally my favorite chocolate candy, and will most likely remain so for the rest of my life, unless I have a sudden change of heart. This candy just has the perfect peanut butter texture, and is overall a really solid candy, and therefore deserves its place on the podium.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Courier New">Number 2:Hubba Bubba. Hubba Bubba is an incredible brand of bubble gum. The flavors are excellent, the gum itself is excellent for bubble blowing, and it's enjoyable even if you just treat it as a chewy candy. The flavor in my opinion lasts longer than other brands of gum like Extra and Trident. While it may have its flaws in that inevitably, it will lose its flavor, I still say that it lasts longers than most candies would, making it the second best.</p>
        <p style="font-family:verdana">Number 1: Laffy Taffy. While this may be a sort of controversial pick, as many may absolutely despise the likes of taffy, I think it might just be the best thing in the entire world. The taste is so sweet, yet also chewy, and while it may get stuck in your teeth, I consider that to be a small downside, considering I am getting the best candy in the world. It's like getting the chewiness of gum, but the sweetness of Nerds. It's pure bliss, and to think you can buy a whole bag for only $10! </p>
